# Homework 11: LRU and LFU Cache

## Problem

In this homework, your job is to write two small programs to implement **LRU** and **LFU** cache, including following methods: `get(key)` and `put(key, value)`.

[**LRU**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Recently_Used), or **L**east **R**ecently **U**sed algorithm, and [**LFU**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_frequently_used), or **L**east **F**requently **U**sed algorithm are both cache algorithm used to manage memory within a computer.

### LRU

```c++
class LRUCache {
public:
    LRUCache(int capacity) {
        // TODO: your code here
    }

    int get(int key) {
        // TODO: your code here
    }

    void put(int key, int value) {
        // TODO: your code here
    }
};
```

### LFU

```c++
class LFUCache {
public:
    LFUCache(int capacity) {
        // TODO: your code here
    }

    int get(int key) {
        // TODO: your code here
    }

    void put(int key, int value) {
        // TODO: your code here
    }
};
```

## Requirement

Design and implement data structure of LRU and LFU cache, and try doing both operations in _O(1)_ time complexity (optional).

`get(key)` Get the value of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.

`put(key, value)` Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate _the least recently used_ or _the least frequently used_ item before inserting a new item. When there is a tie in LFU, _the least recently used_ key would be evicted.
